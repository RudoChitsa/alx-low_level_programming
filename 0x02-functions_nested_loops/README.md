Description
What you should learn from this project:

What are nested loops and how to use them
What is a function and how do you use functions
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
What is a prototype
Scope of variables
What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
What are header files and how to to use them with #include
0. _putchar
Write a program that prints putchar, followed by a new line.
1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
2. 10 x alphabet
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
3. islower
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
4. isalpha
Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.
5. Sign
Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
9. Learn your times table
Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
10. a + b
mandatory
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

Prototype: int add(int, int);.
11. 98 Battery Street, the OG
mandatory
Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
Numbers should be printed in order
The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
The last printed number should be 98
You are allowed to use the standard library

12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself
#advanced
Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.

Prototype: void print_times_table(int n);
If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything
Format: see example
Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
